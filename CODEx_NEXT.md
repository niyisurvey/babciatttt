You are Codex working inside this repo.

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- Do NOT ask me any questions. Do NOT offer choices. Do NOT wait for confirmation.
- If a decision is needed, pick the safest default and continue.
- If build/tests/devices fail due to environment, record it in RUNNING_HANDOFF.md and continue coding anyway.
- Do NOT change styling unless explicitly required. Use our DesignSystem components only.

TASK:
Continue implementing the remaining PRD v1.0 “Pierogi Protocol” items beyond what’s already implemented:
- Replace Weather tab usage: WeatherView is design reference only, NOT a user-facing tab anymore.
- Home should become the “Hub”: shop + stats + history + XP/points pot overview + streak + daily target info.
- Gallery stays placeholder for now.
- Keep Areas flow and DreamRoom placeholder image in AreaDetail, but DO NOT attempt the scaling-header effect yet (that is a separate ticket).

DELIVERABLES:
- Implement remaining PRD screens + wiring so the app is usable end-to-end without Weather tab.
- Keep changes DS-safe and minimal. Avoid refactors unrelated to the PRD.

OUTPUT:
- Summary of changes + exact file list.
- Update RUNNING_HANDOFF.md + PROJECT_STATE.md with what you did and what’s left.
